            <p class="Introduction">
              While the Pokemon franchise has beeen developing games for over two decades now, the quality of the games and the console they're playend on has been volatile.
              <br>
              <br>With that being true, there has to be an objectively best Pokemon gamen and in the following article I will elaborate on why I have chosen Pokemon HeartGold as the epitome of Pokemon game development.

            <p2>
              Crisp graphics are always superior, right? Well, while you can make that argument for games such as GTA, Fortnite, Far Cry and the like, some games pose an exception to that rule.
              The most popular game in the World with over <strong>200 million sales</strong> is Minecraft, closely followed by Tetris. If your are familiar with these games, you'd know that the appeal of these titles is not the HD Graphics or the amazing ray tracing lighting effects, but the nostalgia and unique gameplay. Same goes for Pokemon.
              <br>
              <br>
              With the first Pokemon titles being released right before the turn of the millenina and the console being a small handheld gadget, the Graphics, even for the time, were subpar. Despite that, the games managed to fetch a huge audience through the unique battle system and amazing character design which appeals to every collectors heart.
              <br>
              <br>
              While newer switch titles fail to capture the nostalgic feel of the original Pokemon games, the Ninetndo DS was the perfect compromise of visual advancement and balance of nostalgia.
